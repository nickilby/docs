# Environment Handlers Documentation

This module provides handlers for managing environments, including creating, scaling, shrinking, and deleting environments. It also includes utility functions for networking and server configurations.

## Dependencies
- `logging`, `re`, `uuid` for logging, regex operations, and unique ID generation
- `http.HTTPStatus` for standardized HTTP response codes
- `ipaddress.IPv4Network` for network operations
- `flask` for request handling and response management
- `pydantic.ValidationError` for data validation
- Various modules from `automation_rest`, `pkg_config`, and `pkg_platform` for infrastructure operations

## Functions

### `find_environment_by_alias(alias: str)`
Finds an environment by alias. If not found, aborts with `404 NOT FOUND`.

### `check_site_exists(environment: dict, site_name: str)`
Checks whether a site exists within an environment.

### `get_server_in_environment(environment: dict, server_name: str) -> Optional[Any]`
Retrieves a server from an environment by name.

### `get_servers_by_role(value, role_name)`
Returns a list of servers that match the specified role.

### `get_environments(root_path, extra_fields=None)`
Retrieves all available environments.

### `get_environments_by_pod(root_path, name, extra_fields=None)`
Retrieves environments by pod name.

### `check_server_in_environment(environment, server_name)`
Checks whether a specified server exists in the given environment.

### `scale_environment_internal(alias, environment)`
Scales up a Kubernetes environment by duplicating worker nodes.

### `shrink_environment_internal(alias, environment)`
Shrinks a Kubernetes environment by removing worker nodes if more than one exists.

### `get_ftp_info(root_path: str, ip: str, environment_data: dict) -> dict`
Retrieves FTP information for an environment.

### `create(environment_request_data: dict) -> dict | Any`
Creates a new environment based on the provided request data.

### `configure_environment_network(environment: dict) -> Tuple[str, dict] | dict`
Configures network settings for an environment.

### `delete_environment(environment: dict) -> dict`
Deletes a specified environment.

### `environment_edit_config(environment: dict, environment_settings: dict) -> dict`
Edits environment settings and triggers necessary updates.

### `get_environments_by_user(user: ZenhubUserSchema) -> list[dict]`
Retrieves environments associated with a given user.

## Notes
- The module ensures proper allocation of resources using predefined schemas.
- It includes logic for scaling Kubernetes environments dynamically.
- API interactions depend on automation scripts for provisioning and configuration updates.

This documentation provides an overview of environment handlers and their functionalities.
